Sample Task: Genomic Data Parsing and Analysis

Task Description:
You are given a file containing DNA sequences in FASTA format, and your goal is to write a Python script that reads the file, identifies the sequences, calculates their lengths, and generates a report summarizing the sequence lengths.

Requirements:

Write a Python script to read the FASTA file and parse the DNA sequences.
Calculate the length of each DNA sequence.
Generate a report that includes:
The total number of sequences.
The minimum, maximum, and average sequence lengths.
A histogram of sequence lengths in intervals (e.g., 0-100, 100-200, etc.).
Ensure that the script is well-documented and includes comments to explain the code's functionality.

Evaluation Criteria:

Correctly parsing the FASTA file and extracting DNA sequences.
Accurately calculating sequence lengths.
Generating a comprehensive report with the required statistics and histogram.
Code quality, including readability, appropriate variable names, and commenting.
